plantuml as a container
===

## Install

The easiest way would be to grab the [script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x646e78/docker-plantuml/master/plantuml) and add it to `/usr/local/bin` or elsewhere in your PATH.

## Running

You can then run with 

    plantuml <diagram.puml>

SVG and PNG output will be saved into `out/`
